Two Types -> StateFull / StateLess

1. StateFull -> Data maintained in backend /Depends on State / Memory intensive on server

client --> username/password --> server
server --> session uid --> client
client --> request + uid --> server
server --> response --> client

uid : cookies/response/headers

SSR -> Cookies(ejs)
CSR -> Headers(rest apis)

Express Flow: Client -> Auth Middleware --> valid uid --> next()/reject

Best Practices:

- required/unique/timestamps in DB
- Different route for Auth -> user.js
- Separate Frontend in views -> signup/login
- send cookie as uuid 

2. Stateless -> data not maintained -> State present in payload

-using jwt

client --> username/password --> server
server --> send jwt (hashed) with payload --> client
client --> request + jwt --> server
server --> response --> client
