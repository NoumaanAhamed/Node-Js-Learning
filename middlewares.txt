Middleware runs on every request and response
They have access to execute any code/(req,res,next)/End the req-res cycle

Client -> Req -> Middleware -> Client
or
Client -> Req -> Middleware -> Server -> Client

middlewares execute in order (next)

app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    next(); -> goes to next middlewares
})

ex. make 'log.txt' for every request as middlewares
